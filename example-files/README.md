# Example Project

This directory contains an example annotation project (`example-project`) and four agreement evaluation files generated by the following commands:

```shell
# instance-based agreement
brat-iaa example-project/ --heatmap instance-agreement-heatmap.png > instance-agreement-report.md

# token-based agreement
brat-iaa example-project/ -t --heatmap token-agreement-heatmap.png > token-agreement-report.md
```

In the example data Max systematically annotates long spans instead of multiple short ones, e.g. "\[<sub>LOC</sub> Grenoble (Francia)\]" instead of "\[<sub>LOC</sub> Grenoble\] (\[<sub>LOC</sub> Francia\])", which results in a large difference between instance- and token-based agreement.
